   <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
    
   <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
    
    <p>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p> 
    
   <li type="circles"> * the Cold War</li> 
    
   <li type="circles"> * the civil-rights movement </li>  
    
    <li type="circles">* the growth of the international drug trade</li>
